# Game Description
The game is about avoiding the missiles. Use W A S D to control the space ship. The space ship has momentum control. The missiles will spawn and if they hit you, you will take some damage. The hearts run away from you and they give you health if you touch them. The text on top is for showing the distance to the grenade. It will destroy all the ships.
# Code Location
All of the important code is in the Assets/Scripts folder.
